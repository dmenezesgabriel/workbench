# Rendering Patterns

## Introduction

The rendering patterns are a set of rules that define how the rendering of a
component is done. They are used to define the rendering of a component in
different contexts, such as:

- **Server-side rendering**: The component is rendered on the server and the
  resulting HTML is sent to the client.

- **Client-side rendering**: The component is rendered on the client and the
  resulting HTML is inserted into the DOM.

- **Static rendering**: The component is rendered on the server and the
  resulting HTML is saved to a file.

- **Hybrid rendering**: The component is rendered on the server and the
  resulting HTML is sent to the client. On the client, the component is
  rendered again and the resulting HTML is inserted into the DOM.
