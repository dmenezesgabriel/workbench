# Data Structures

## Map

A map is a data structure that stores key value pairs. The keys are unique and the values can be anything. Maps are also known as dictionaries, hashmaps, and associative arrays.

## Graph

A graph is a data structure that stores nodes and edges. The nodes are also known as vertices. The edges are also known as arcs. A graph can be directed or undirected. A directed graph has edges that point in a specific direction. An undirected graph has edges that do not point in a specific direction. A graph can also be weighted or unweighted. A weighted graph has edges that have a weight. An unweighted graph has edges that do not have a weight.
