# Concepts

## Memoization

Memoization is a technique that allows you to cache the result of a function call based on its parameters. This is useful when you have a function that is expensive to run, but you know that it will return the same result for the same parameters.

## Recursion

Recursion is a technique that allows a function to call itself. This is useful when you have a problem that can be broken down into smaller subproblems that are similar to the original problem.

## Big O Notation

Big O notation is a way of describing the performance of an algorithm. It is used to describe the worst case scenario for an algorithm. It is used to describe the performance of an algorithm in terms of the number of operations required to complete the algorithm.
