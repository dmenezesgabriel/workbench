## Linked Lists

### Singly Linked List

In short a singly linked list is a list of nodes that have a pointer to the next node in the list. The last node in the list points to null. The first node in the list is called the head and the last node is called the tail. The head and tail are the only nodes that are not pointed to by another node. The list can be traversed by starting at the head and following the next pointers until you reach the tail. The list can be traversed in reverse by starting at the tail and following the previous pointers until you reach the head.

### Doubly Linked List

A doubly linked list is a list of nodes that have a pointer to the next node and a pointer to the previous node. The first node in the list is called the head and the last node is called the tail. The head and tail are the only nodes that are not pointed to by another node. The list can be traversed by starting at the head and following the next pointers until you reach the tail. The list can be traversed in reverse by starting at the tail and following the previous pointers until you reach the head.

### Circular Linked List

A circular linked list is a list of nodes that have a pointer to the next node in the list. The last node in the list points to the head. The first node in the list is called the head and the last node is called the tail. The head and tail are the only nodes that are not pointed to by another node. The list can be traversed by starting at the head and following the next pointers until you reach the tail. The list can be traversed in reverse by starting at the tail and following the previous pointers until you reach the head.

## Trees

### Binary Tree

A binary tree is a tree where each node has at most two children. The children are usually called left and right. The top node in the tree is called the root. The root is the only node in the tree that does not have a parent. The nodes at the bottom of the tree are called leaves.

## Stacks

Stacks are a data structure that follow the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the last item added to the stack is the first item removed from the stack. Stacks have two main operations, push and pop. Push adds an item to the top of the stack and pop removes the top item from the stack.

## Queues

Queues are a data structure that follow the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. This means that the first item added to the queue is the first item removed from the queue. Queues have two main operations, enqueue and dequeue. Enqueue adds an item to the end of the queue and dequeue removes the first item from the queue.

## Sort

### Merge Sort

Merge sort is a divide and conquer sorting algorithm. It divides the input array into two halves, calls itself for the two halves, and then merges the two sorted halves. The merge function is used for merging two halves.

### Quick Sort

Quick sort is a divide and conquer sorting algorithm. It picks an element as pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot. There are many different ways to pick a pivot. The pivot can be the first element, the last element, the middle element, or a random element. The partition function is used for partitioning the array around the pivot.

## Search

### Binary Search

Binary search is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array. If the target value is equal to the middle element, then the position is returned and the search is finished. If the target value is less than the middle element, then the search continues on the lower half of the array. If the target value is greater than the middle element, then the search continues on the upper half of the array. This process continues until the target value is found or the array is empty.

### Depth First Search

In short depth first search is a search algorithm that starts at the root and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. Depth first search uses a stack to keep track of the nodes to visit next. Depth first search can be used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.

### Breadth First Search

In short breadth first search is a search algorithm that starts at the root and explores all of the neighbor nodes at the present depth before moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. Breadth first search uses a queue to keep track of the nodes to visit next. Breadth first search can be used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.
